    Rogue Photo is a nonprofit photojournalism publication and stock photo hub of political demonstrations and actions. Our mission is to document protests in opposition of discrimination, bigotry, silencing of the press, and defunding of government agencies. Rogue Photo is a community of photographers and artists who encourage one another to continue their path towards professional photojournalism. Lobbying at government spaces are also important to capture; documenting meetings with legislative representatives can be historic and useful. Photos are then donated to non-profits (American Civil Liberties Union, NYCLU, CAIR-NY, New York Immigration Coalition, National Organization for Women, African Communities Together) and other organizations that are in need of high resolution photos. Previous projects have ranged from live update twitter accounts, postcards that are sent to congress, kickstarter campaigns for musicians, documentaries, websites, and yearbooks.

    Some of our progress is being shown in the press and we would like to show thanks.
